            <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
            <p>
                Color My Mood is a non-intrusive extension that does not collect or store any personal 
                data from its users. The extension operates entirely locally on your device, and no 
                information is sent to external servers or third parties.

                <strong>User-Selected Mood Data: </strong>
                Color My Mood allows you to select a mood to change the color theme of websites you visit. This data is not recorded or stored and is only used temporarily to apply the selected theme.

                <strong>Browsing Data: </strong>
                We do not track, collect, or store your browsing history, website content, or any other data related to your online activities.
